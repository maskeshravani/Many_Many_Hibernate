# Many_Many_Hibernate

This repository demonstrates various Hibernate ORM relationship mappings, including One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many.

One-to-Many Example (Library and Books):

A library can have multiple books, but each book is linked to one library.
Many-to-One Example (Employee and Department): Multiple employees can belong to a single department, but each employee is assigned to one department.

Many-to-Many Example (Books and Authors):

Books can have multiple authors, and authors can write multiple books.


Many-to-Many Example (Students and Courses): 

Students can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.


One-to-Many Example (University and Students): 

A university can have multiple students, with each student associated with a single university.


The repository uses dynamic input through Scanner, allows establishing relationships at runtime, and cascades save for related entities. These examples showcase how Hibernate manages entity relationships efficiently.
